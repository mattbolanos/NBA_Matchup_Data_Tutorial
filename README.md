This repository provides a quick tutorial on how to scrape NBA matchup data from stats.nba.com. Although it is simple to find matchup data from individual player pages (https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1626164/head-to-head/, for example), there is no way to separate games. In other words, there is no way to see the breakdown of which Milwaukee Bucks defenders were guarding Devin Booker in the 2021 NBA Finals in Game 1 versus Game 2, only the combined totals from all 6 Finals games. I used the detailed box score endpoint from the NBA API to scrape the various matchups for whatever game the user inputs the corresponding game ID for.
